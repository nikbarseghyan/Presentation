### About

This stories tries to cover a quick approach for getting started with Nginx logs analysis using ELK stack, Its will provide a developer as starting point of reference for using ELK stack. It doesn't cover the details of working of these individual components. Also I’ll try to cover certain key aspects which I found missing in the other earlier written getting started docs for same purpose.

# Flow A Static Type Checker for JavaScript
### About

Flow is a static type checker for your JavaScript code. It is developed at Facebook and is often used with React. It lets you annotate the variables, functions, and React components with a special type syntax, and catch mistakes early. You can read an introduction to Flow to learn its basics.
If you use run:
```
npm install --save-dev flow-bin
yarn add --dev flow-bin
```
If you use run:
```
npm run flow init
yarn run flow init
```

Stripping Flow Syntax from the Compiled Code
Flow extends the JavaScript language with a special syntax for type annotations. However, browsers aren’t aware of this syntax, so we need to make sure it doesn’t end up in the compiled JavaScript bundle that is sent to the browser.

The exact way to do this depends on the tools you use to compile JavaScript.
